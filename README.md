# VideoGame-Map-Pathfinding

Welcome to the VideoGame-Map-Pathfinding repository, a comprehensive Python project designed to solve pathfinding problems on video game maps using Dijkstra's algorithm and A* with the Octile distance heuristic. This project is ideal for those interested in game development, AI implementations in navigation, and educational purposes related to algorithmic studies.

## Features

- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Implements Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path on a grid map with uniform cost movements.
- **A* Search**: Uses the A* search algorithm with the Octile distance heuristic to efficiently find paths considering diagonal movements.
- **Map Visualization**: Includes functionality to visualize the pathfinding process on the map, showing explored nodes and the final path.
- **Performance Analysis**: Compares the performance of Dijkstra's and A* in terms of time and nodes expanded with visual plots.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several directories:

- `src`: Contains all Python source files with the implementations of the algorithms and map handling.
- `plots`: Stores the output plots comparing the performance of the pathfinding algorithms.
